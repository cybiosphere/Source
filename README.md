## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Cybiosphere is a Metavers dedicated to ecology and eco-evolution study.
An infinite number of vegetal and animal species interacting with each other can be created and inserted in the virtual world without restarting the system.
The ecosytem can be explored in 3D and time can be accelerated (up to x1000) to monitor its evolution on long durations.
The software solution provides a complete multi agent system that supports for each individual entity: genetic, reproduction, neuronal networks for animal behavior, innate instinct and acquired experience, energy balance, individual fitness, predation, symbiosisâ€¦ This covers a large part of the structuring factors of ecosystems and simulates spatial and temporal mechanisms that affect their evolution.

### <a name="cybiosphere-wizard"></a>Cybiosphere wizard

The wizard is a tool dedicated to new specie creation. It is running only under Microsoft Windows.
It is recommended to generate more than 10 animals of each new specie using automatic genetic variations available in the tool in order to have allele variety from the beginning. 

### <a name="cybiosphere-studio"></a>Cybiosphere studio

The studio is the main user interface. It is running only under Microsoft Windows.
Studio can run as Standalone, Server or Client mode, but usage is quite similar in every mode.
It can be used to edit genomes, modify animal behavior using stick/carrot teaching mode, monitor populations evolution, ....

### <a name="cybiosphere-server"></a>Cybiosphere server console

Server console is the core of the system. It is running under Linux or windows. By default, it is running on 4 CPU cores.
Many different kind of clients can connect to the server using IP-port link: studio, 3D explorer, client console for coprocessing.
In current version 2 clients coprocessors can connect so that 12 CPU cores will be used to process entity actions

### <a name="cybiosphere-client"></a>Cybiosphere client console

Client console is mainly used for coprocessing. It is running under Linux or windows. Each coprocessor will support entity actions in a specific location of the biotope

### <a name="cybiosphere-3d"></a>Cybiosphere 3D explorer

3D explorer is a client that allows to visit the biotope. For the moment camera does not interact with animals. It is only a way to visualize the ecosystem. It is mostly useful to check the realism of animal behavior
