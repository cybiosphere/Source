## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Cybiosphere is a kind of Metavers dedicated to ecology and eco-evolution.
An infinite number of vegetal and animal species interacting with each others can be created and inserted in the virtual world without restarting the system.
The virtual worl can be explored in 3D and time can be accelerated (up to x100) to monitor ecological and evolutive mechanisms on long durations.

### <a name="cybiosphere-wizard"></a>Cybiosphere wizard

The wizard is a tool dedicated to new specie creation. It is running only under Microsoft Windows
It is recommended to generate more than 10 animals of each new specie using automatic genetic variations available in the tool in order to have allele variety from the beginning. 

### <a name="cybiosphere-studio"></a>Cybiosphere studio

The studio is the main user interface. It is running only under Microsoft Windows
Studio can run as Standalone, Server or Client mode, but usage is quite similar in every mode.
It is can be used to edit genomes, modify animal behavior using stick/carrot learning, monitor populations evolution, ....

### <a name="cybiosphere-server"></a>Cybiosphere server console

Server console is the core of the system. By default, it is running on 4 CPU cores.
Many different kind ofclient can connect to the server using IP-port: studio, 3D explorer, client console for coprocessing
In current version 2 clients coprocessors can connect so that 12 CPU cores will be used to process each entity action

### <a name="cybiosphere-client"></a>Cybiosphere server client

Client console is mainly used for coprocessing. Each coprocessor will support entities actions in a specific location of the biotope

### <a name="cybiosphere-3d"></a>Cybiosphere 3D explorer

3D explorer is a client that allow to visit the biotope. For the moment camera does not interact with animals. It is only a way to visualize the ecosystem. It is mostly useful to check the realism of animal behavior
